this is my online music project
## project statement:
To find the most up-to-date information about symphony
music schedules, I recommend checking the official
website of your local symphony orchestra or major
concert venues in your area. Alternatively, you can search 
for symphony events on ticketing websites, event
calendars, or by using search engines to find updated
information on concerts, performances, and schedules.

## project Description:
The Symphony Music Schedule project is a user-friendly digital platform, providing an interactive event calendar
with upcoming symphony music performances, including details like dates, times, venues, orchestras, and 
conductors. Users can filter events based on preferences and receive personalized alerts and reminders.
The application collaborates with orchestras and venues for automatic updates, ensuring accuracy. With user accounts
attendees can save favorite events and access tailored recommendations. The project fosters community 
engagement through user reviews and ratings. It aims to promote classical music appreciation, supporting
orchestras and musicians while enriching the symphony experience for music enthusiasts.
