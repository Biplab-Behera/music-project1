# music-project1
this is my online music project
## project statement:
To find the most up-to-date information about symphony
music schedules, I recommend checking the official
website of your local symphony orchestra or major
concert venues in your area. Alternatively, you can search 
for symphony events on ticketing websites, event
calendars, or by using search engines to find updated
information on concerts, performances, and schedules.
